<p>Before we knew it, the gang of us were in Korea. One thing led to another and the three of us met up with some other Singaporeans that were studying in Korea as well. A girl came along and to be honest, I grew quite fond of her. </p><p>However I was attached at that time and didn't even consider her. However, one day I found myself standing in front of her, with her confessing her feelings to me. You told me it was how I sent the wrong signals all the time and that you felt disgusted seeing what I do. You told me how you used to look up to me but now the words you are telling me are just saying that I am a morally corrupted bastard. </p><p>I didn't take time out to make the girl fall in love with me. Nor did I ever tried my luck to get into her pants. However, if that is truly how you view me as a friend and a person. I am deeply saddened and disappointed, for you do not know me at all. I could argue with you and pull you off from your moral high horse that you have been riding on, judging everyone that you pass. I choose not to, for I have given up on our relationship. </p><p>The girl and I have made up and are just friends now. We go out but have been spotted by you a couple of times, I do not even bother to walk up to you and defend myself anymore. You can think what you want, because you are in your own little bubble, thinking you are the absolute truth. The Alpha and Omega. Talking about how morally upright you are now and presenting everyone with the image that you are smart and capable. It's my turn now to say, I am disgusted by what I see in you. </p><p>Fun times were fun. But I'm sorry, but I do not need a friend like you. Especially one that uses others for his/her own benefits. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">Seblovesyoutiao</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
